# Notes


## FizzBuzz

- add fizz buzz examples from rosetta
- add others??
- add ruby fizzbuzz example - in detailed (functional style)

## Hello, World!

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program
- https://helloworldcollection.github.io

There are variations in spirit, as well. Functional programming languages, like Lisp, ML and Haskell, tend to substitute a factorial program for Hello, World, as functional programming emphasizes recursive techniques, whereas the original examples emphasize I/O, which violates the spirit of pure functional programming by producing side effects.

## update eurostones primes

- use samples from rosetta stone ?



## Add Memory Mangagement Language Table ???

- Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection) vs Hand-Crafted/Hand-Coded/Manual


## Add a table of Data Types ??

- add data types of ruby here ??




## Add "Modern" Lang Features Table ??

- Pattern Matching
- Concurrent (with Actors/Messages/Processes/Mailboxes) - Nothing Shared
- Fault-Tolerant
- Distributed
- Immutable Data Structures
- and and ??


## Performance / Speed

## Popularity (Metrics)

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_programming_language_popularity


## Packages / Module (Counts) / Libraries


## Add more codes samples for rosetta stone ??

- hello world
- quicksort
- Fibonacci sequence
- bitcoin address checker / validator ??

## Comparison of Programming languages

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm

Common programming paradigms include:

- imperative which allows side effects,
- functional which disallows side effects,
- declarative which does not state the order in which operations execute,
- object-oriented which groups code together with the state the code modifies,
- procedural which groups code into functions,
- logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar, and
- symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar.
