# Notes


## FizzBuzz

- add fizz buzz examples from rosetta
- add others??
- add ruby fizzbuzz example - in detailed (functional style)

## Hello, World!

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program
- https://helloworldcollection.github.io

There are variations in spirit, as well. Functional programming languages, like Lisp, ML and Haskell, tend to substitute a factorial program for Hello, World, as functional programming emphasizes recursive techniques, whereas the original examples emphasize I/O, which violates the spirit of pure functional programming by producing side effects.
